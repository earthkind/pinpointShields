Exploration of infrastructures which protect glaciers heating at points of critical structural leverage, to minimize glacial melt and disintegration

The melting of *continental* glaciers around the world is an urgent problem, because those glaciers are drinking water reserves for local communities.

When the glaciers melt, less water can be stored, and people have less water to drink.

I've always felt like there could be a minimally-obtrusive intervention to help slow this melting and preserve the glacial water reserves.

For example, a network of local solar shades that hovers over critical sections of the glacier (critical to preserve structural integrity) and slows warming in those areas -- when weather conditions call for it (e.g. warm and sunny days.)

This wouldn't necessarily need to be an everyday intervention. Perhaps there is some Pareto efficiency, where 20% of days produce 80% of the glacial warming -- and the intervention could be designed for those 20% of the days specifically.
